niconicotwitch
==============
A plugin used for twitch.tv to mimick the text scrolling style of the popularly niche japanese video streaming site niconico (www.nicovideo.jp)
The code was hacked together over a weekend after waking up with inspiration.

for now paste the code into the javascript console after loading up a live streaming video on www.twitch.tv.

If I ever come back to this I'll try to make it into its own plugin.
